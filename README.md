## Project for Deep Learning Methods for Calibrated Photometric Stereo and Beyond: A Survey

## Introduction: Photometric stereo
Photometric stereo methods obtain detailed shape reconstructions from multiple images under different illuminations. The orange box shows the general non-Lambertian surface reflectance. To solve the non-Lambertian surface, many methods have addressed non-Lambertian photometric stereo. This paper focuses on deep learning-based calibrated photometric stereo methods and provides a comprehensive review.
